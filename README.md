# React + Vite

#  Getting Started with Your React Vite App
This README.md file provides essential instructions to set up and run your React application using Vite locally.

#  Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: Vite development requires Node.js (which includes npm). You can download it from nodejs.org. It's recommended to use the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn: These are package managers used to install project dependencies. npm is installed automatically with Node.js. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it globally:

npm install -g yarn

A text editor or IDE: Such as VS Code.

#  Installation
Follow these steps to get your React Vite application up and running:

Clone the repository (if applicable):
If your project is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone it to your local machine:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

If you've received the files directly, navigate to your project directory in your terminal.

Install dependencies:
Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal and install all required packages:

npm install
# or
yarn install

This command reads the package.json file and downloads all the necessary libraries and frameworks into the node_modules folder.

#  Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Start the development server:
In the project directory, run:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

This command starts the Vite development server.

Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided in your terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173). The app will hot-reload as you make edits.

#  Building for Production
To create an optimized production build of your application:

Build the app:

npm run build
# or
yarn build

This command builds the app for production to the dist folder. Vite optimizes the build for the best performance, including minification and asset hashing.

Preview the production build (optional):
You can locally serve the built files to test the production version:

npm run preview
# or
yarn preview

This will serve the dist folder, typically on http://localhost:4173 (or another port).
